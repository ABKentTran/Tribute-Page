                 Bruce lee's most famous quote before passing
             </h3>
             <blockquote class="quote">
                 <h4>
                    Be Water, My Friend.
                    Empty your mind.
                    Be formless, shapeless, like water.
                    You put water into a cup, it becomes the cup.
                    You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle.
                    You put it into a teapot, it becomes the teapot.
                    Now water can flow or it can crash.
                    Be water, my friend.
